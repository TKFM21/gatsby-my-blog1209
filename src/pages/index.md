    Kaldi is the コーヒー store for everyone who believes that great コーヒー
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for コーヒー lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take コーヒー production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good コーヒー has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow コーヒー lovers and learn about
        コーヒー making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our コーヒー to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the コーヒー’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
